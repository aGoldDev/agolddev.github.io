            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m a 16-year-old from the Philippines with a passion for technology, especially coding. I find immense joy in building projects and solving complex problems—all just for fun! Programming is not just a skill for me; it's a hobby and a challenge that keeps my mind sharp and my creativity flowing. My journey in coding started with small projects, and gradually, I've become more confident in experimenting with different languages and tools. I love exploring new programming concepts, from algorithms to web development, and the satisfaction of making something work exactly as planned is unmatched.<br>
            <br>
            Aside from coding, I am also a speedcuber—I enjoy solving the Rubik's cube as quickly as possible. Speedsolving combines logic, pattern recognition, and fast finger movements, which require both mental and physical agility. I practice consistently to improve my solve times and push my personal limits. My fascination with speedcubing comes from the challenge of solving in seconds what would normally take people much longer. Whether it’s coding a new project or perfecting my speedcubing techniques, I am constantly inspired to learn, improve, and have fun along the way. These interests allow me to connect with like-minded people, and I am always excited to see where these hobbies will take me in the future.</p>
